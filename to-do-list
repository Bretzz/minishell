EXPORT
	1. unset the exported variable
	2. without arg do 'env' (DO EXPORT)

NOTE: variables can be 'shell', 'export' or 'enviroment'
(difference between
	'unset pippo; export pippo=tuamamma'
			and
	'unset pippo; export pippo')

PIPESTATUS
	An array variable (see Section 6.7 [Arrays], page 100) containing a list of
	exit status values from the processes in the most-recently-executed foreground
	pipeline (which may contain only a single command).

"<< LIMITER" witout a command just reprints the heredoc (like "<< LIMITER cat")
also Ctrl-D in heredoc:
	zsh: list wierd stuff
	bash: warning: here-document at line 4 delimited by end-of-file (wanted `LIMITER')

also unfollowd pipe, ex: 'cat |', does weird stuff
also ls | > out redirect inside the pipe and don't write in 'out' (just parsing check)

CURSED COMMAND (ZSH):
	c2r3p6% ls | << prut cat | grep la | > pippo; cat pippo
	heredoc> lol
	heredoc> alalready excluded?
	heredoc> prut
	playlists
	alalready excluded?
playlist: file found by ls, and grep'd
alalready excluded?: found in heredoc and grep'd

CURSED COMMAND (BASH):
	topiana-@c2r3p6: ls | << prut cat | grep la > pippo; cat pippo
	lalalala
	lololo
	prut
	lalalala (output di pippo)

check precise command: 'exitt' != 'exit' (DONE)

EXTRA
	"cd ..; pwd" changes dir
	"pwd; cd .." doesn't

"| | |"
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `|'

"mkdir a | grep c": creates the dir and closes the pipe
"grep c | mkdir b": grep is waiting the std in, BUT DIR IS MADE INSTANTLY
(check command priority when unrelated in pipe)

REDO: pwd, cd
	(just change the PWD='/global/path/to/folder' variable)
	(beware of errors)

Invalid Name for vars (only [a-z,A-Z,_] allowed)

EXPORT:
	norminette ft_export
	also var=value to check for valname validity
	generally check for value length < MAX_VAL_LEN (REMOVE PLS)
	just use write of size and strichr to print on 'export'
