EXPORT
	1. unset the exported variable
	2. without arg do 'env' (DO EXPORT)

NOTE: variables can be 'shell', 'export' or 'enviroment'


PIPESTATUS
	An array variable (see Section 6.7 [Arrays], page 100) containing a list of
	exit status values from the processes in the most-recently-executed foreground
	pipeline (which may contain only a single command).

CURSED COMMAND:
	c2r3p6% ls | << prut cat | grep la | > pippo; cat pippo
	heredoc> lol
	heredoc> alalready excluded?
	heredoc> prut
	playlists
	alalready excluded?
playlist: file found by ls, and grep'd
alalready excluded?: found in heredoc and grep'd


check precise command: 'exitt' != 'exit' (DONE)

"<< LIMITER" witout a command just reprints the heredoc (like "<< LIMITER cat")
